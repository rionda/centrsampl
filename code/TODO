We are going to implement our code in Python3.3.1, using the igraph library
(http://igraph.sourceforge.net)

Download graph data from snap.stanford.edu/data (Matteo should already have them
somewhere on his laptop)

# DONE! Implement converter to convert them from the native format (list of
# edges?) to an igraph (http://igraph.sourceforge.net) graph

Convert graphs to igraph format

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path to take into account the
possibility of multiple shortest paths

# DONE! Implement diameter approximation algorithm for undirected, unweighted graphs

Implement sampling procedures

# DONE! Implement Brandes exact algorithm for betweenness centrality
