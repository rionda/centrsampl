We are going to implement our code in Python3.3.1, using the igraph library
(http://igraph.sourceforge.net)

Download graph data from snap.stanford.edu/data (Matteo should already have them
somewhere on his laptop)

Convert graphs to igraph format

Implement ALENEX paper sampling algorithm

Implement adaptive sampling algorithm

Implement code to automatize experiments and reports

# DONE! Implement converter to convert them from the native format (list of
edges?) to an igraph graph

# DONE! Implement Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path to take into account the
possibility of multiple shortest paths

# DONE! Implement diameter approximation algorithm for undirected, unweighted graphs

# DONE! Implement VC sampling algorithm

# DONE! Implement Brandes and Pich sampling algorithm

# DONE! Implement Brandes exact algorithm for betweenness centrality

# DONE! Implement code to compare results
