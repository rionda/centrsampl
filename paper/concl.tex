\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:concl}
In this work we presented two random-sampling-based algorithms for accurately and
efficiently estimate the betweenness centrality of the (top-$K$) vertices in a
graph, with high probability.
%For very large graphs, exact computation of the
%betweenness centrality is impossible, so one has to resort to an approximation.
Our algorithms take a different approach than previous ones achieving the same
guarantees~\citep{BrandesP07,GeisbergerSS08,JacobKLPT05} as it is based on a
completely novel application of results from VC-dimension theory. These results
allow us to show that the number of samples needed to approximate the
betweenness with the desired accuracy and confidence is much smaller than that
suggested by previous works. Moreover, our algorithm performs much less work
per sample than other algorithms. We tested our algorithm on many real graphs
and showed that it is many times faster than other proposed methods. In future
work we would like to explore the possibility of extending our methods to
generalizations of betweenness centrality~\citep{DolevEP10} and to other centrality
measures. On the more theoretical side, we believe that the bound presented in
Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimuppbound} is strict in the sense that there are graphs $G$
whose $\range_G$ has VC-dimension exactly $\lfloor\log_2\Delta_G\rfloor+1$, and
we have preliminary results in this sense that need formalization.
