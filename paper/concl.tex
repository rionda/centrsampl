\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:concl}
In this work we presented two random-sampling-based algorithms for accurately and
efficiently estimate the betweenness centrality of the (top-$K$) vertices in a
graph, with high probability.
%For very large graphs, exact computation of the
%betweenness centrality is impossible, so one has to resort to an approximation.
Our algorithms take a different approach than previous ones achieving the same
guarantees~\citep{BrandesP07,GeisbergerSS08,JacobKLPT05} as they are based on a
completely novel application of results from VC-dimension theory. These results
allow us to show that the number of samples needed to approximate the
betweenness with the desired accuracy and confidence is much smaller than that
suggested by previous works. Moreover, our algorithms perform much less work
than other algorithms. We tested our algorithms on many real and artificial
graphs and showed that they are many times faster than other proposed methods.
In future work we would like to explore the possibility of extending our methods
to generalizations of betweenness centrality~\citep{KourtellisASIT12,DolevEP10}
and to other centrality measures.
