@article{RodittyW12,
	Abstract = {In this paper we consider the fundamental problem of approximating the diameter $D$ of directed or undirected graphs. In a seminal paper, Aingworth, Chekuri, Indyk and Motwani [SIAM J. Comput. 1999] presented an algorithm that computes in $\Ot(m\sqrt n + n^2)$ time an estimate $\hat{D}$ for the diameter of an $n$-node, $m$-edge graph, such that $\lfloor 2/3 D \rfloor \leq \hat{D} \leq D$. In this paper we present an algorithm that produces the same estimate in $\Ot(m\sqrt n)$ expected running time. We then provide strong evidence that a better approximation may be hard to obtain if we insist on an $O(m^{2-\eps})$ running time. In particular, we show that if there is some constant $\eps>0$ so that there is an algorithm for undirected unweighted graphs that runs in $O(m^{2-\eps})$ time and produces an approximation $\hat{D}$ such that $ (2/3+\eps) D \leq \hat{D} \leq D$, then SAT for CNF formulas on $n$ variables can be solved in $O^{*}((2-\delta)^{n})$ time for some constant $\delta>0$, and the strong exponential time hypothesis of [Impagliazzo, Paturi, Zane JCSS'01] is false.},
