\section{A range set on shortest paths}\label{sec:rangeset}
We now define a range set on the set of shortest paths of a graph $G=(V,E)$, and present 
a tight upper bound to its VC-dimension. We use the range set and the bound in
the analysis of our algorithms for estimating the betweenness centrality of
vertices of $G$.

The range set $\range_G$ is defined on the set $\mathbb{S}_G$ of all shortest
paths between vertices of $G$. It contains, for each vertex $v\in V$, the set
$\mathcal{T}_v$ of shortest paths that $v$ is internal to:
\[
\range_G = \{\mathcal{T}_v ~:~ v\in V\}\enspace.
\]

Given a graph $G=(V,E)$, assume, for technical reasons, that $|E|\ge 2$ (the
case $|E|=1$ is trivial), and let $\mathsf{H}(G)$ be the maximum integer $d$
such that there are $h=\lfloor\log_2(d-2)\rfloor+1$ shortest paths
$\{p_1,\dotsc,p_h\}$ in $\mathbb{S}_G$ of size at least $d$ and such that the
collection $\{\mathsf{Int}(p_1),\dotsc,\mathsf{Int}(p_h)\}$ is an anti-chain,
i.e., a collection of sets such that for no two sets in it one is a subset of
the other. Note that since $|E|\ge 2$ and the size of a path is always at least
$2$, then the formula for $h$ is always well defined.



\begin{lemma}\label{lem:vcdimuppbound}
  %Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with vertex-diameter $\Delta_G$, the range set
  %$\range_G$ associated to the shortest paths in $G$ has VC-dimension
  %$\VC(\range_G)\le\lfloor\log_2(\VD(G)-2)\rfloor+1$.
  $\VC(\range_G)\le\lfloor\log_2(\mathsf{H}(G)-2)\rfloor+1$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Let $\ell>\lfloor\log_2(\mathsf{H}(G)-2)\rfloor+1$ and assume for the sake of contradiction
that $\VC(\range_G)=\ell$. From the definition of VC-dimension there is a set
$Q\subseteq\mathbb{S}_G$ of size $\ell$ that is shattered by $\range_G$.
For any two shortest paths $p',p''$ in $Q$ we must have neither
$\mathsf{Int}(p')\subseteq\mathsf{Int}(p'')$ nor
$\mathsf{Int}(p'')\subseteq\mathsf{Int}(p')$, otherwise one of the two paths
would appear in all ranges where the other one appears, and so it would be
impossible to shatter $Q$. Then $Q$ must be such that the collection of the
sets of internal vertices of the paths in $Q$ form an anti-chain. From this and
from the definition of $\mathsf{H}(G)$ we have that $Q$ must contain a path $p$ of
size $|p|\le\mathsf{H}(G)$. There are  $2^{\ell-1}$ non-empty subsets of
$Q$ containing the path $p$. Let us label these non-empty subsets of $Q$ containing $p$ as
$S_1,\dotsc,S_{2^{\ell-1}}$, where the labelling is arbitrary.
Given that $Q$ is shattered, for each set $S_i$ there must be a range $R_i$ in
$\range_G$ such that $S_i=Q\cap R_i$. Since all the $S_i$'s are
different from each other, then all the $R_i$'s must be different from each
other. Given that $p$ is a member of every $S_i$, $p$ must also belong to each
$R_i$, that is, there are $2^{\ell-1}$ distinct ranges in $\range_G$ containing
$p$. But $p$ belongs only to the ranges corresponding to internal vertices of
$p$, i.e., to vertices in $\mathsf{Int}(p)$. This means that the number of ranges
in $\range_G$ that $p$ belongs to is equal to $|p|-2$. But $|p|\le\mathsf{H}(G)$ by
definition of $\mathsf{H}(G)$, so $p$
can belong to at most $\mathsf{H}(G)-2$ ranges from $\range_G$. Given that
$2^{\ell-1}>\mathsf{H}(G)-2$, we reached a contradiction and there cannot be $2^{\ell-1}$
distinct ranges containing $p$, hence not all the sets $S_i$ can be expressed as
$Q\cap R_i$ for some $R_i\in\range_G$. Then $Q$ cannot be shattered and
$\VC(\range_G)\le\lfloor\log_2(\mathsf{H}(G)-2)\rfloor+1$.
\end{proof}

Computing $\mathsf{H}(G)$ is not a viable option, but given that
$\mathsf{H}(G)\le\VD(G)$, we have the following corollary.

\begin{corollary}\label{corol:vcdimuppbound}
  $\VC(\range_G)\le\lfloor\log_2(\VD(G)-2)\rfloor+1$.
\end{corollary}

%\begin{proof}
%Let $\ell>\lfloor\log_2(\VD(G)-2)\rfloor+1$ and assume for the sake of contradiction
%that $\VC(\range_G)=\ell$. From the definition of the VC-dimension there is a set
%$Q\subseteq\mathbb{S}_G$ of size $\ell$ that is shattered by $\range_G$. Let $p$ be
%an element of $Q$. There are  $2^{\ell-1}$ non-empty subsets of
%$Q$ containing the path $p$. Let us label these non-empty subsets of $Q$ containing $p$ as
%$S_1,\dotsc,S_{2^{\ell-1}}$, where the labelling is arbitrary.
%Given that $Q$ is shattered, for each set $S_i$ there must be a range $R_i$ in
%$\range_G$ such that $S_i=Q\cap R_i$. Since all the $S_i$'s are
%different from each other, then all the $R_i$'s must be different from each
%other. Given that $p$ belongs to each $S_i$, then $p$ must also belong to each
%$R_i$, that is, there are $2^{\ell-1}$ distinct ranges in $\range_G$ containing
%$p$. But $p$ belongs only to the ranges corresponding to internal vertices of
%$p$, i.e., to vertices in $\mathsf{Int}(p)$. This means that the number of ranges
%in $\range_G$ that $p$ belongs to is equal to $|p|-2$. But $|p|\le\VD(G)$, by
%definition of $\VD(G)$, so $p$
%can belong to at most $\VD(G)-2$ ranges from $\range_G$. Given that
%$2^{\ell-1}>\VD(G)-2$, we reached a contradiction and there cannot be $2^{\ell-1}$
%distinct ranges containing $p$, hence not all the sets $S_i$ can be expressed as
%$Q\cap R_i$ for some $R_i\in\range_G$. Then $Q$ cannot be shattered and
%$\VC(\range_G)\le\lfloor\log_2(\VD(G)-2)\rfloor+1$.%\qed
%\end{proof}

\subsection{Unique shortest paths}\label{sec:rangeunique}
In the restricted case when the graph is undirected and
every pair of distinct vertices has either none or a unique shortest path
between them, the VC-dimension of $\range_G$ reduces %collapses
to a \emph{constant}. This is a
somewhat surprising result with interesting consequences. From a theoretical
point of view, it suggests that there should be other characteristic
quantities of the graph different from the vertex diameter that control the
VC-dimension of the range set of shortest paths, and these quantities are
constant on graph with unique shortest paths between vertices. From a more
practical point of view, we show in Sect.~\ref{sec:algo} that this result has an
impact on the sample size needed to approximate %for approximating
the betweenness centrality of
networks where the unique-shortest-path property is satisfied or even enforced,
like road networks~\citep{GeisbergerSS08}. In particular, the resulting sample
size will be \emph{completely independent} from any characteristic of the
network, and will only be a function of the parameters controlling the desired
approximation guarantees.

Due to space constraints, we defer the proof to the extended online version of
the paper~\citep{RiondatoK13}.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:vcdimuppboundunique}
  Let $G=(V,E)$ be an undirected graph with $|\mathcal{S}_{uv}|\le1$ for all
  pairs $(u,v)\in V\times V$. Then $\VC(\range_G)\le 3$.
%  Given an undirected
%  graph $G=(V,E)$ such that $|\mathcal{S}_{uv}|\le1$ for all
%  pairs $(u,v)\in V\times V$, the range set $\range_G$ of the
%  shortest paths in $G$ has VC-Dimension $\VC(\range_G)\le3$.
\end{lemma}

\ifproof
\begin{proof}
%\begin{IEEEproof}
  In this restricted setting, if two different shortest paths $p_1$ and $p_2$
  ``meet'' at a vertex $u$, then they either continue together to a vertex
  $v\neq u$ or they separate never to ``meet again'' at any other
  vertex $v\neq u$. More formally if the node coming after $u$ in $p_1$ and
  $p_2$ is different (or exists only for one path but not for the other), then
  the subpaths of $p_1$ and $p_2$ starting from $u$ have an empty intersection.
  This is easy to see: if they could separate at $u$ and then meet again at some
  $v$, then there would be two distinct shortest paths between $u$ and $v$,
  which is a contradiction of the hypothesis. Let us denote this fact as
  $\mathsf{F}$.

  Assume now that $\VC(\range_G)>3$, then there must be a set
  $Q=\{p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4\}$ of four shortest paths that can be shattered by
  $\range_G$. Then there is a vertex $w$ such that $\mathcal{T}_w\cap Q=Q$, i.e.,
  all paths in $Q$ go through $w$. Let $x$ be the farthest predecessor of $w$
  along $p_1$ that $p_1$ shares with some other path from $Q$, and let $y$ be
  the farthest successor of $w$ along $p_1$ that $p_1$ shares with some other
  path from $Q$. It is easy to see that if either $x$ or $y$ (or both) do not
  exist, then $Q$ cannot be shattered, as we would incur in a contradiction of
  fact $\mathsf{F}$.

  Let us then assume that both $x$ and $y$ exist.
  Let $Q_x=\mathcal{T}_x\cap Q$ and $Q_y=\mathcal{T}_y\cap Q$.
  From fact $\mathsf{F}$, we have that all paths in $Q_x$ must go through the
  same vertices between $x$ and $w$ and all paths in $Q_y$ must go through the
  same vertices between $w$ and $y$. This also means that all paths in $Q_x\cap
  Q_y$ must go through the same vertices between $x$ and $y$. If $Q_x\cup
  Q_y\subsetneq Q$, let $p^*\in Q\setminus(Q_x\cup Q_y)$. Since $p^*$ and $p_1$
  are distinct, then from this, from the definition of $x$ and $y$, and from
  fact $\mathsf{F}$ we have that there is no vertex $v$ such that
  $\mathcal{T}_v\cap Q=\{p_1,p^*\}$, which implies that $Q$ can not be
  shattered. Indeed if there was a vertex $v$ such that $\mathcal{T}_v\cap
  Q=\{p_1,p^*\}$, the paths $p_1$ and $p^*$ would meet in $w$ and $v$; which
  contradicts fact $F$.


  From now we can therefore consider only the case $Q_x\cup Q_y=Q$. If $Q_x\cap
  Q_y=Q$, then all the paths in $Q$ go through the same vertices between $x$ and
  $y$. From this and the definition of $x$ and $y$ we have that there is no
  vertex $v$ such that, for example, $\mathcal{T}_v\cap Q=\{p_1,p_2\}$, hence
  $Q$ cannot be shattered. Suppose instead that $Q_x\cap Q_y\subsetneq Q$ and let $S=(Q_x\cap
  Q_y)\setminus\{p_1\}$. If $S\neq\emptyset$ then there is at least a path
  $p'\in S$ which, from the definition of $S$ and fact $\mathsf{F}$, must go
  through all the same vertices as $p_1$ between $x$ and $y$. Moreover, given
  that $Q_x\cap Q_y\neq Q$, there must be a path $p''\in Q\setminus\{p_1\}$
  different from $p_1$ such that $p''\notin S$. Then, from the definition of
  $x$, $y$, and $S$, and from the existence of $p'$, there can be no vertex $v$
  such that $\mathcal{T}_v\cap Q=\{p_1,p''\}$, hence $Q$ cannot be shattered.
  Assume now that $S=\emptyset$ and consider the case $Q_x=\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$,
  $Q_y=\{p_1,p_4\}$ (all other cases follow by symmetry with this case ).
  Consider the set $\{p_1,p_3\}$. From the definition of $x$ and $Q_x$, and from
  fact $\mathsf{F}$ we have that there can not be a vertex $v$ between the end
  point of $p_1$ before $x$ (according to $p_1$) and $w$ such that $\mathcal{T}_v\cap Q=\{p_1,p_3\}$.
  At the same time, from the definition of $y$ and from fact $\mathsf{F}$, we
  have that such a $v$ can not be between $w$ and the end point of $p_1$ after
  $y$. This implies that $Q$ can not be shattered.

  We showed that in all possible cases we reached a contradiction and $Q$,
  which has size $4$, can not be shattered by $\range_G$. Hence $\VC(\range_G)\le
  3$, which concludes our proof.
%\end{IEEEproof}
\end{proof}

\paragraph{The case of directed graphs.} It is natural to ask whether the above
lemma or a similar result also holds for \emph{directed} graphs. Fact
$\mathsf{F}$ does not hold for directed graphs so the above proof does not
extend immediately. In Fig.~\ref{fig:counterexample} we show a directed graph
for which there is a set of four shortest paths that can be shattered. For any
pair of vertices in the graph, there is at most one shortest path connecting
them. Consider now the following four directed shortest paths:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $p_A=\{1,2,4,6,7,13,14,16,17,18,22,21\}$
  \item $p_B=\{8,9,10,5,12,13,14,16,17,18,26,27\}$
  \item $p_C=\{25,24,26,18,19,15,14,7,6,5,4,3\}$
  \item $p_D=\{23,20,22,17,16,15,14,7,6,5,10,11\}$
\end{itemize}
It is easy to check that the set $Q=\{p_A,p_B,p_C,p_D\}$ is shattered and
Table~\ref{tab:counterexampleshatter} shows, for each subset $R\subseteq Q$, the
vertex $v$ such that $R=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_v$. This means that
Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimuppboundunique} is not true for directed graphs. It is an
open question whether it is true for a different constant.

%\subsection{Variants}\label{sec:rangevariants}
\paragraph{Bounded-distance betweenness}
For the case of $k$-bounded-distance betweenness, if we let
$\range_G^{(k)}=\{\mathcal{T}_v^{(k)}~:~ v\in V\}$, it is easy to bound
$\VC(\range_G^{(k)})$ following the same reasoning as in
Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimuppbound}.
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:vcdimuppboundk}
$\VC(\range_G^{(k)})\le\lfloor\log_2(k-1)\rfloor+1$.
\end{lemma}
\fi

\subsection{Tightness}\label{sec:tightness}
The bound presented in Corol.~\ref{corol:vcdimuppbound} (and therefore
Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimuppbound}) is strict in the sense that
for each $d\ge 1$ we can build a graph $G_d$ with vertex-diameter
$\VD(G_d)=2^d+1$ and such that the range set $\range_{G_d}$ associated to the set of
shortest paths of $G_d$ has VC-dimension exactly
$d=\lfloor\log_2(\VD(G_d)-2)\rfloor+1$. 
%For the sake of clarity, we will discuss
%only the case of undirected graphs with equal edge weights, but all we say can
%be easily adapted to the general case.

\ifproof
We now introduce a class $\mathcal{G}=(G_d)_{d\ge 1}$ of graphs indexed by $d$.
The graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ are the ones for which we can show the tightness of
the bound to the VC-dimension of the associated range set.
We call the graph $G_d\in\mathcal{G}$ the \emph{$d$\textsuperscript{th} concertina graph}.
Figure~\ref{fig:tightgraphs} shows $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$, and $G_4$. The
generalization to higher values of $d$ is straightforward.
By construction, $\VD(G_d)=2^d+1$, so that
$\lfloor\log_2(\VD(G_d)-2)\rfloor+1=d$. The $G_d$ concertina graph has 
$3(2^{d-1})$ vertices and they can be partitioned into three classes,
\emph{top}, \emph{bottom}, and \emph{middle},
according to their location in a drawing of the graph similar to those in
Fig.~\ref{fig:tightgraphs}. $G_d$ has $2^{d-1}-1$ top vertices, $2^{d-1}-1$
bottom vertices, and $2^{d-1}+2$ middle vertices. For each top vertex $v$, let
$\mathsf{f}(v)$ be the \emph{corresponding bottom vertex}, i.e., the bottom
vertex $u$ whose two neighbors are the same two middle vertices that are
neighbors of $v$. Analogously, the \emph{corresponding top vertex} of a bottom
vertex $w$ is the top vertex $v$ such that $\mathsf(v)=w$. Among the middle
vertices, the two with degree 1 are special and are called the \emph{end
vertices} of $G_d$ and denoted as $v_\ell$ and $v_\mathrm{r}$, where the labels
can be arbitrarily assigned. 

In Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimlowbound} we build a set $Q$ of $d$ shortest paths from
$v_\ell$ to $v_\mathrm{r}$ and show that it is shattered by $\range_{G_d}$,
therefore proving that $\VC(\range_{G_d})\ge d$. This fact, together with
Coroll.~\ref{corol:vcdimuppbound}, allows us to conclude that $\VC(\range_{G_d})=d$. 
\else
There is a class $\mathcal{G}=(G_d)_{d\ge 1}$ of graphs indexed by d, such that
the graphs in $\mathcal{G}$ are the ones for which we can show the tightness of
the bound to the VC-dimension of the associated range set. We call the graph
$G_d\in\mathcal{G}$ the \emph{$d$-th concertina graph}.
Figure~\ref{fig:tightgraphs} shows $G_1$, $G_2$, $G_3$, and $G_4$. The
generalization to higher values of $d$ should be straightforward. Each graph
$G_d$ has $3(2^{d-1}$ vertices and vertex-diameter $d$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:vcdimlowbound}
  $\VC(\range_{G_d})=d$.
\end{lemma}
\ifproof
\begin{proof}
%\begin{IEEEproof}
  Let $D=\{1,2,3,\dotsc,d\}$. The proof proceeds as follows: 
  \begin{enumerate}
	  \item Define a map $\mathsf{r}$ from
		  $\mathcal{S}=2^D\setminus\{\emptyset,D\}$ to set of of top and bottom
		  vertices of $G_d$.
	  \item Use the map $\mathsf{r}$ to build the set $Q$ of $d$ shortest paths
		  from $v_\ell$ to $v_\mathrm{r}$.
	  \item Show that $Q$ is shattered by $\range_{G_d}$, implying
		  $\VC(\range_{G_d}\ge d$.
	  \item Conclude from the above and from Corol.~\ref{corol:vcdimuppbound}
	  	  that $\VC(\range_{G_d}=d$.
  \end{enumerate}

  \paragraph{1.~Defining the map $\mathsf{r}$.} For any set (of subsets of
  $D$) $s'\in\mathcal{S}$, let $\mathsf{c}(s')=D\setminus s'$. The set (of
  subsets of $D$) $\mathsf{c}(s')$ is the \emph{unique} set (of subsets of $D$)
  $s''\in\mathcal{S}$ such that $s'\cap s''=\emptyset$ and $s'\cup s''=D$.
  
  We can partition $\mathcal{S}$ in two sets $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$
  ($\mathcal{A}\cup\mathcal{B}=\mathcal{S}$, $\mathcal{A}\cap
  \mathcal{B}=\emptyset$) as follows: for any \emph{unordered pair}
  $(s',\mathsf{c}(s'))$, we arbitrarily put $s'$ in $\mathcal{A}$ and
  $\mathsf{c}(s')$ in $\mathcal{B}$. It is easy to see that
  $|\mathcal{A}|=|\mathcal{B}|=2^{d-1}-1$, which is the number of top vertices
  of $G_d$ (and the number of bottom vertices of $G_d$)

  We now build a mapping $\mathsf{r}_\mathcal{A}$
  (resp.~$\mathsf{r}_\mathcal{B}$) that will map each element of $\mathcal{A}$
  (resp.~of $\mathcal{B}$) to a \emph{top} (resp.~\emph{bottom})
  vertex of $G_d$. We will then use these mappings to build the set of paths to
  be shattered.
  
  Let $\mathsf{r}_\mathcal{A}$ be an arbitrary one-to-one map from each element
  of $\mathcal{A}$ to a top vertex of $G_d$ (i.e., it maps a set of subsets of
  $D$ to a top vertex). We now build the one-to-one map $\mathsf{r}_\mathcal{B}$
  from each element of $\mathcal{B}$ to a bottom vertex of $G_d$. Consider the
  inverse map $\mathsf{r}^{-1}_\mathcal{A}$ from the top vertices of $G_d$ to
  the elements of $\mathcal{A}$ and let $v$ be any top vertex of $G_d$. For any
  top vertex $v$, $\mathsf{r}^{-1}_\mathcal{A}(v)$ is a set of subsets of $D$,
  and a element of $\mathcal{A}$ (and of $\mathcal{S}$), and therefore there is
  an element $s''$ of $\mathcal{B}$ such that
  $s''=\mathsf{c}(\mathsf{r}^{-1}_\mathcal{A}(v))$.
  
  The bijection $\mathsf{r}_\mathcal{B}$ maps the element
  $\mathsf{c}(\mathsf{r}^{-1}_\mathcal{A}(v))$ of $\mathcal{B}$ to the bottom
  vertex $\mathsf{f}(v)$ corresponding to $v$. In other words, if a set $s'$ of
  subsets of $D$ is mapped by $r_\mathcal{A}$ to a top vertex $v$, then
  $r_\mathcal{B}$ maps to the bottom vertex $\mathsf{f}(v)$ the unique set $s''$
  of subsets of $D$ such that $s''=\mathsf{c}(s')$.
  
  It is easy to see that, if we take the union of $\mathsf{r}_\mathcal{A}$ and
  $\mathsf{r}_\mathcal{B}$, we obtain a map $\mathsf{r}$ from $\mathcal{S}$ to
  the set of top and bottom vertices of $G_d$. An example of a possible
  $\mathsf{r}$ for $G_3$ is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:mapexample}.

  \paragraph{2.~Building the set $Q$ of shortest paths.} We now build the set
  $Q=\{p_1,\dotsc,p_d\}$ which contains $d$ shortest paths from $v_\ell$ to
  $v_\mathrm{r}$. Given the definition of $G_d$, it should be clear that all
  these shortest paths must go through all other middle vertices of $G_d$. Let
  $M$ be the set of all middle vertices in $G_d$, and consider the set
  $E=V\setminus M$ (i.e., $E$ is the set containing all the top and bottom
  vertices of $G_d$. For any $i\in D$, the \emph{set} of vertices that the path
  $p_i\in Q$ goes through is the set $P_i=M\cup\{v\in E ~:~ i \in r^{-1}(v)\}$.
  We build the path $p_i$ by sorting the vertices in $P_i$ in increasing order
  by their shortest path distance from $v_\ell$. There is a unique such ordering
  of the vertices in $P_i$, as they all have different shortest path distances
  from $v_\ell$. It is easy to see that $p_i$ is a shortest path. Note that a
  path $p_i\in Q$ goes through a top vertex $v$ if and only if
  $i\in\mathsf{r}^{-1}_A(v)$. Analogously, $p_i$ goes through a bottom vertex
  $u$ if and only if $i\in\mathsf{r}^{-1}_B(u)$. 

  \paragraph{3.~Showing that $Q$ is shattered by $\range_{G_d}$.} We now show
  that the set $Q$ of shortest paths is shattered by $\range_{G_d}$. We want to
  show that each subset $s$ of $Q$ can be expressed as the intersection between
  $Q$ and a range $\mathcal{T}_v\in\range_{G_d}$, for some vertex $v$ in $G_d$.
  Consider first the case $s=Q$ (as $Q$ is a subset of itself). All paths in $Q$
  go through all the middle vertices that are not $v_\ell$ or $v_\mathrm{r}$, so
  if we let $v_Q$ be any arbitrary middle vertex different from $v_\ell$ or
  $v_\mathrm{r}$, we have $Q=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_{v_Q}$. Also, given that $v_\ell$
  is not \emph{internal} to any path in $Q$, we have
  $\emptyset=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_{v_\ell}$.
  
  Let now $\mathcal{Q}=2^{Q}\setminus\{\emptyset,Q\}$ and denote with $I_s$
  the set of indexes $i\in D$ such that $p_i\in s$. We want to show that
  $s=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{r}(I_s)}$. It is easy to see that $s\subseteq
  Q\cap\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{r}(I_s)}$, as the vertex $\mathsf{r}(I_s)$ is
  internal to all paths in $s$, by definition of $\mathsf{r}(I_s)$ and of the
  paths in $Q$. On the other end, no path in $Q\setminus s$ belongs to
  $Q\cap\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{r}(I_s)}$ as no path in $Q\setminus s$ goes through
  $\mathsf{r}(I_s)$ because it goes through the corresponding vertex of
  $\mathsf{r}(I_s)$ (this corresponding vertex is a top vertex if
  $\mathsf{r}(I_s)$ is a bottom vertex, and a bottom vertex otherwise). Hence we
  showed that $s=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_{\mathsf{r}(I_s)}$
  for any $s\in\mathcal{Q}$.
  
  We showed that all subsets of $Q$ can be expressed as the intersection between
  $Q$ and a range from $\range_{G_d}$, which means that $Q$ is shattered and
  therefore $\VC(\range_{G_d})\ge d$.
  
  \paragraph{4.~Concluding the proof.} From Corol.~\ref{corol:vcdimuppbound} we
  know that $\VC(\range_{G_d})\le d$, so it must be $\VC(\range_{G_d})=d$, which
  concludes our proof.

The upper bound presented in Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimuppboundunique}  for the case
of unique shortest paths is also strict in the same sense.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:vcdimlowboundunique}
  There is a graph $G=(V,E)$ with $|\mathcal{S}_{uv}|\le1$ for all
  pairs $(u,v)\in V\times V$ such that the range set $\range_G$ associated to the
  shortest paths in $G$ has VC-Dimension exactly $3$.

\end{figure}

\begin{proof}
%\begin{IEEEproof}
  Consider the graph $G$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:uniquetight}.
  Let $p_1=(a,b,c,e,i,j)$, $p_2=(m,f,e,i,k,l)$, $p_3=(d,c,e,f,g,h)$ be three
  paths. We now show that $Q=\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}$ can be shattered by $\range_G$, which
  implies $\VC(\range_G)\ge 3$. We have $\emptyset=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_a$,
  $\{p_1\}=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_b$, $\{p_2\}=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_k$,
  $\{p_3\}=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_g$, $\{p_1,p_2\}=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_i$,
  $\{p_1,p_3\}=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_c$, $\{p_2,p_3\}=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_f$,
  $\{p_1,p_2,p_3\}=Q\cap\mathcal{T}_e$.  
  Hence all subsets of $Q$ can be expressed as the intersection between $Q$ and
  some range in $\range_G$ which means that $Q$ can be shattered and
  $\VC(\range_G)\ge 3$. Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimuppboundunique} gives us an upper
  bound $\VC(\range_G)\le3$, so we can conclude that $\VC(\range_G)=3$.
%\end{IEEEproof}
\end{proof}

Although the example in Fig.~\ref{fig:uniquetight} is a tree, this is not a
requirement for either Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimuppboundunique} or
Lemma~\ref{lem:vcdimlowboundunique}: in a weighted graph with cycles (i.e., not
a tree) the weights may be such that there is a unique shortest path between any
pair of connected vertices.
