  We present an efficient randomized algorithm for approximating the {\sl
  betweenness centrality} of all nodes in a network within strict probabilistic
  guarantees.  Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure in social network
  analysis, quantifying the importance or influence of individual nodes in a
  network in terms of the number of shortest paths (between all pairs of nodes
  in the network) that pass through that node. The fastest known algorithm to
  compute the exact betweenness of all vertices in a graph $G=(V,E)$ in
  $O(|V|\cdot|E|)$ steps in the unweighted case and in
  $O(|V|\cdot|E|+|V|^2\log|V|)$ steps in weighted graphs. Exact computation in
  large networks with millions of vertices and hundred of millions of edges is
  therefore prohibitively expensive and fast approximation algorithms are
  required in these cases. Our novel algorithm computes an
  $(\epsilon,\delta)$-approximation of the vector of betweenness centrality of
  all the nodes in the graph. Our algorithm is significantly faster than any
  other algorithm with similar approximation guarantees. We achieve this speed
  up through a novel application of the VC-dimension method for optimizing the
  sampling component of the algorithm. Extensive experimental evaluation on real
  and artificial networks demonstrate the practicality of our method and its
  speed up compared to exact and other known approximated solutions for this
  problem.
