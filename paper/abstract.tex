  Betweenness centrality is an important measure in (social) network analysis as
  it allows to rank the vertices by their ``prominence'' in the network. The
  betweenness of a vertex $v$ is, roughly, the number of shortest paths between
  all vertices that pass through $v$. The fastest known algorithm to compute
  the exact betweenness of all vertices in a graph $G=(V,E)$ requires time
  $O(|V|\cdot|E|)$ if the edges have no weight and time
  $O(|V|\cdot|E|+|V|^2\log|V|)$ for weighted graphs. Exact computation in large
  networks with millions of vertices and hundred of millions is therefore
  prohibitively expensive and fast approximation algorithms are required in
  these cases. In this work we develop an algorithm based on random sampling to
  approximate the betweenness of all the nodes. It offers probabilistic
  guarantees that the estimated betweenness of each vertex is very close to its
  real value. Each sample is a random shortest path between two randomly chosen
  vertices of the graph. The required sample size depends on the desired
  accuracy $\varepsilon$ and confidence $\delta$ and on a characteristic
  quantity $\delta$ of the graph that we call \emph{vertex-diameter}, viz.~the
  maximum number of vertices in a shortest path. The resulting sample size
  $|S|=O(\log(\Delta/\delta)/\epsilon^2)$ is a huge improvement over existing
  algorithms offering the same guarantees. In the experimental evaluation on
  real and artificial networks we compared the performance of our algorithm
  with that of exact and approximated methods and show that our algorithm is
  much faster.
