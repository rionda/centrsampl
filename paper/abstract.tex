  %We present an efficient randomized algorithm for approximating the {\sl
  %betweenness centrality} of all nodes in a network within strict probabilistic
  %guarantees.
  Betweenness centrality is a fundamental measure in social network
  analysis, quantifying the importance or influence of individual vertices in a
  network in terms of the fraction of shortest paths that pass through that node. 
  %The fastest known algorithm to
  %compute the exact betweenness of all vertices in a graph $G=(V,E)$ in
  %$O(|V|\cdot|E|)$ steps in the unweighted case and in
  %$O(|V|\cdot|E|+|V|^2\log|V|)$ steps in weighted graphs. 
  Exact computation in large networks %with millions of vertices and hundred of millions of edges 
  is prohibitively expensive and fast approximation algorithms are required in
  these cases. 
  We present two efficient randomized algorithms that offer probabilistic
  guarantees on the quality of the approximation. One algorithm computes an
  $(\varepsilon,\delta)$-approximation of the vector of betweenness centrality
  of all the vertices in the graph. The second algorithm focuses on the top-K
  vertices with highest betweenness and computes an approximation for the
  corresponding vector with each component being within a multiplicative factor
  $\varepsilon$ from the real value, with probability at least $1-\delta$. This
  is the first algorithm that reaches such approximation for the top-K vertices.
  Our algorithms are significantly faster than previously presented algorithms
  with similar approximation guarantees. We achieve this speedup through a
  novel application of the VC-dimension theory to optimize the sampling
  component of the algorithms. Extensive experimental evaluation on real
  networks demonstrate the practicality of our methods and their performances
  compared to exact and approximated approximated solutions.
