\paragraph{Our contributions} 
We present an algorithm to approximate the betweenness centrality of all the
vertices in a graph. The algorithm is based on random sampling of shortest
paths. The analysis to derive the sufficient sample size uses results from
VC-Dimension theory. This results in a much smaller sample size than that used
by other algorithms guaranteeing the same approximation. Moreover, the amount
of work performed per sample is also less than what was done in previous works.
We extensively evaluated our method on real graphs and compared its
performances to the exact algorithm for betweenness
centrality~\citep{Brandes01} and to other sampling based
algorithms~\citep{BrandesP07,JacobKLPT05}.
