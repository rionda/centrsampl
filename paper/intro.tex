\paragraph{Our contributions} 
We present two randomized algorithms to approximate the betweenness centrality
(and some of its variants) of vertices of a graph. The first algorithm
guarantees that the estimated betweenness values for all vertices are within an
\emph{additive} factor $\varepsilon$ from the real values, with probability at
least $1-\delta$. The second algorithm focuses on the top-$K$ vertices with
highest betweenness and returns a set of vertices which includes the top-$K$,
while ensuring that the estimated betweenness for all returned vertices is
within a \emph{multiplicative} factor $\varepsilon$ from the real value, with
probability at least $1-\delta$. This is the first algorithm to reach such a
high-quality approximation for the set of top-$K$ vertices. The algorithms are
based on random sampling of shortest paths. The analysis to derive the
sufficient sample size uses notions and tools from VC-Dimension theory. This
results in a much smaller sample size than that used by other algorithms
guaranteeing the same approximation. Moreover, the amount of work performed by
our algorithms per sample is also less than what was done in previous works.
We extensively evaluated our methods on real graphs and compared their
performances to the exact algorithm for betweenness
centrality~\citep{Brandes01} and to other sampling-based approximation
algorithms~\citep{JacobKLPT05,BrandesP07}.
