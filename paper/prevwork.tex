%The work of~\citet{EppsteinW04} deployed sampling to approximate the closeness
%centrality. Specifically, the authors proposed an
%$O(\frac{\mbox{log}n}{\epsilon^2}(n\mbox{log}n+m))$ randomized algorithm with
%additive error of $\epsilon \Delta$ for approximating the inverse closeness
%centrality of weighted graphs, where $\Delta$ is the diameter of the graph.
