\section{Experimental evaluation}\label{sec:exper}
We conducted an experimental evaluation of our algorithms, with two major
driving goals in mind: to study the behavior of the algorithms presented in this
paper and to compare it with that of other related
algorithms~\citep{Brandes01,BrandesP07,JacobKLPT05,GeisbergerSS08}, in terms of
accuracy of the estimation, execution time, work performed, and scalability as
function of the network size. 

\paragraph{Implementation and environment}
We implemented\footnote{We plan to make our software available after
acceptance.} our algorithms, the one presented in~\citep{BrandesP07,JacobKLPT05}
and the linear scaling version from~\citep{GeisbergerSS08} in C, by extending
the implementation of the exact algorithm~\citep{Brandes01} contained in
igraph~\citep{igraph}. The implementations are similarly engineered, given that
they are based on the same subroutines for the computation of the shortest path
(Dijkstra's algorithm for weighted graphs, BFS for unweighted ones), and they
received similar amounts of optimization. We exposed our implementations through
Python 3.3.1, which was used for running the simulations. We run the experiments
on a quad-core AMD Phenom\texttrademark II X4 955 Processor with 16GB of RAM,
running Debian \emph{wheezy} with a Linux kernel version 3.2.0.

\paragraph{Datasets} We used a number of graphs from the Stanford Large
Network Dataset
Collection\footnote{\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html}}. These are
all real world datasets including online social networks, communication (email)
networks, scientific citation and academic collaboration networks, road
networks, Amazon frequent co-purchased product networks, and more. Basic
information about the graphs we used are reported in the leftmost part
of~\cref{tab:expDir,tab:expUndir}. We refer the
reader to the SLNDC website for additional details about each dataset. 
To evaluate scalability we also created a number of artificial graphs of
different sizes (1,000 to 100,000 vertices) using the Barab\'asi-Albert
model~\citep{BarabasiA99} as implemented by igraph~\citep{igraph}. \XXX Are
there parameters of the Barabasi-Albert model we should mention?

\paragraph{Diameter approximation}
As we discussed in the previous sections the number of samples that the proposed
algorithm requires depends on the vertex-diameter of the graph. 
For the computation of the vertex-diameter in case of undirected graphs we used
the 2-approximation algorithm that we briefly described in Sect.~\ref{sec:algo}.
We denote this as ``diam-2-approx'' when reporting results in this section. For
directed graphs, we computed the number of samples using both the exact value of
the vertex-diameter (indicated as diam-exact) as well as the trivial upper bound
$|V|-1$ (indicated as diam-UB).

\subsection{Accuracy}\label{sec:accuracy}
Our theoretical results from Sect.~\ref{sec:algo} guarantee that, with probability
at least $1-\delta$, all estimations of the betweenness values for all vertices
in the graph are within $\varepsilon$ for their real value. %, that is
%\[
%\Pr(\exists v\in V \mbox{ s.t. }
%|\betw(v)-\tilde\betw(v)|>\varepsilon)<\delta\enspace.
%\]
We run Algorithm~\ref{alg:algorithm} five times for each graph and each value of
$\varepsilon$ in $\{0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.04, 0.06, 0.08, 0.1\}$. The parameter
$\delta$ was fixed to $0.1$ and we used $c=0.5$ in~\eqref{eq:vceapprox} to
compute the sample size, as suggested by~\citet{LofflerP09}. As far as the
\emph{confidence} is concerned, we report that in all the hundreds of runs we
performed, the guarantee on the deviation was \emph{always} satisfied, not just
with probability $1-\delta$ (0.9). We evaluated how good the estimated values
are is by computing the average \emph{estimation error} $(\sum_{v\in
V}|\betw(v)-\tilde\betw(v)|)/|V|$ across five runs of our algorithm and taking
the average and the standard deviation of this measure, for different values of
$\varepsilon$. We also compute the maximum error overall. The results are
reported in~\cref{fig:gnutella:error} for the directed graph p2p-Gnutella30, and
in~\cref{fig:email:error} for the undirected graph email-Enron. It is evident
that the maximum error is an error of magnitude smaller than the guaranteed
value of $\varepsilon$ and that the average error is almost two orders of
magnitude smaller than the guarantees, and the average+standard deviation points
show that the estimation are quite concentrated around the average. We can
conclude that in practice the algorithm performs even better than guaranteed,
achieving higher accuracy and confidence than what the theoretical analysis
indicates. This is due to a number of factors, including the fact that the
vertex-diameter is an \emph{upper bound} to the VC-dimension of the rangeset and
the inherent looseness of the bound to the sample size~\eqref{eq:vceapprox}.

\subsection{Runtime}\label{sec:runtime}
We compared the running time of Algorithm~\ref{alg:algorithm} (denoted in the
following as $\mathsf{VC}$ to that of the algorithm from~\citep{BrandesP07}
(denotes as $\mathsf{BP}$), and to that of the exact
algorithm~\citep{Brandes01}. The performances of the algorithm proposed
in~\citep{GeisbergerSS08} takes the same time as as $\mathsf{BP}$, because it
follows the same sampling approach and only differs in the definiton of the
estimator for the betweenness, so we do not report those.
%as the one
%from~\citep{BrandesP07,JacobKLPT05} and only differs in the definition of the
%estimator for the betweenness of a vertex. Because of this, it takes the same
%amount of time and touches the same number of edges as the one
%from~\citep{BrandesP07}.

%We use two metrics in order to measure the amount of computations that the
%algorithms perform. The first metric is the execution time, or \textit{time}, in
%seconds, the second metric is the number of edges that the algorithm
%touched/traversed, or \textit{touched edges}, during the execution. The number
%of touched edges is a graph theoretic metric \XXX What do you mean by that? that
%does not depend on the specifications of the implementation environment and
%gives a perspective of the amount of work that the algorithm requires. It is
%worth mentioning that we count an edge as many times as it is touched during
%a run of an algorithm, so we might count a single edge more than once.
The algorithms $\mathsf{VC}$ and $\mathsf{BP}$ take parameters $\varepsilon$ and
$\delta$ and compute the sample size accordingly. For our experiments we used
$\delta=0.1$, while $\varepsilon$ takes value in $\{0.01, 0.015, 0.02, 0.04,
0.06, 0.08, 0.1\}$. We run each experiments five times for each value of
$\varepsilon$, and measured the average running time across the runs.
%as well as the average number of touched edges.  
The results are presented in~\cref{tab:expUndir,tab:expDir}
%and~\cref{fig:gnutella:time,fig:gnutella:edges,fig:email:time,fig:email:edges}.
and~\cref{fig:gnutella:time,fig:email:time}. 
%
In~\cref{tab:expUndir} we report, for some of the undirected graphs we tested
and for $\varepsilon=$\XXX WHAT?, the minimum and the maximum ratio of the
running time of $\mathsf{BP}$ over $\mathsf{VC}$, over \XXX how many? runs. As
it can be seen from this table our algorithm performs significantly faster, more
than 300\%, in both measures. Similar results are reported for some directed
graphs in~\cref{tab:expDir}.
%In~\cref{tab:expDir} we compare the
%algorithms on a set of directed graphs. As in the case of the undirected graphs,
%we present the minimum and maximum ratios of corresponding measures for the
%different values of $\varepsilon$. 
The diam-UB
and the diam-exact values can be seen as the two extremes for the performance of 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:algorithm} in terms of runtime. In the case of the diam-exact
we have as few samples as possible (for $\mathsf{VC}$) since we use the exact
value of the vertex-diameter, whereas in the case of diam-UB we have as many
samples as possibles because we use the worst case estimation for the
vertex-diameter of the graph.  %(that is when the graph has a hamiltonian path) <= not correct.  
From~cref{tab:expUndir} we can see that the value for the
vertex-diameter that we consider in the case of diam-UB is many orders of
magnitudes greater than the actual value, which translates in a significant
increase of the number of samples. But even in the case of this crude
vertex-diameter approximation (diam-UB), the $\mathsf{VC}$ algorithm performs uniformly faster than
$\mathsf{BP}$. In the case where the exact value of the diameter was used, we
can see that our algorithm computes an estimation of the betweenness that
satisfies the desired accuracy and confidence guarantees \emph{3 to 5 times
faster} than~\citep{BrandesP07}. \XXX-(COMMENT ON THE RELATION TOPOLOGY-SPEED)
\MR I have no idea what you meant by that. In~\cref{fig:gnutella:time} we study
the directed graph p2p-Gnutella30 and we present the measurements of
the average running time of the algorithms for different values of
$\varepsilon$, using the exact algorithm from~\citep{Brandes01} as baseline. The
$\mathsf{VC}$ algorithm requires significantly less time than the $\mathsf{BP}$
algorithm. \Cref{fig:email:time} shows the average running time of the
algorithms for the undirected graph email-Enron. In this case our
algorithm not only performs better but also \emph{scales} better than the one
from~\citep{BrandesP07} \XXX WHAT DO YOU MEAN SCALES BETTER?. 
%For the computation of the sample size we use the 2-approximation algorithm
%which is enough since what we really use for the computation of sample size is
%the logarithm of the diameter. 
%In~\cref{fig:gnutella:edges,fig:email:edges}, we study the average number of
%touched edges for the case of the directed graph \texttt{p2p-Gnutella30} and of
%the undirected graph \texttt{email-Enron} respectively. It is evident that again
%our algorithm outperforms $\mathsf{BP}$. 
%From the above Figures and Tables we see that for the tested values of
%$\varepsilon$, the proposed algorithm is faster (at least 3x speedup in case of
%exact diameter on the tested graphs). 
Algorithm~\ref{alg:algorithm} is faster than $\mathsf{BP}$ for two reasons, both
originating from from our use of results from the VC-dimension theory: 1) we use
a significantly smaller amount of samples and 2) only in the worst case does
$\mathsf{VC}$ the same amount of computations \emph{per sample} as
$\mathsf{BP}$, because our algorithm needs only to find the shortest path
between a sampled pair of vertices whereas the algorithms
from~\citep{GeisbergerSS08,BrandesP07} need to compute the shortest paths
between a sampled source and all the other vertices. Indeed in our experimental
evaluation we found out that the running time of the algorithms is directly
proportional to the number of edges touched during the shortest path
computation. The use of bidirectional A\textsuperscript{*}
search~\citep{Pohl69,KaindlK97} can help in lowering the number of touched edges
for $\mathsf{VC}$ and therefore the runtime of our algorithm ($\mathsf{BP}$
would not benefit from this improvement). We plan to explore this in future
work.

\subsection{Scalability}\label{sec:scalability}
In Sect.~\ref{sec:discussion} we argued about the reasons why our algorithm is
more scalable than the sampling one offering the same approximation
guarantees~\citep{BrandesP07,GeisbergerSS08,JacobKLPT05}. To evaluate our
argument in practice, we created a number of graphs of increasing size (1,000 to
100,000 vertices) using the Barab\'asi-Albert~\citep{BarabasiA99} and run the
algorithms on them, measuring their running time. We report the results
in~\cref{fig:random:time}. The most-scalable algorithm would be completely
independent from the size (number of vertices) of the graph, corresponding to a
flat (horizontal) line in the plot. Therefore, the less steep the line, the more
independent from the network size would be the corresponding algorithm. From the
figure, we can appreciate that this is the case for our algorithm, which is
much more scalable and independent from the size of the sample than
$\mathsf{BP}$. This is very important, as today's networks are not only huge,
but they also grow rapidly, and algorithms to mine them need to scale well as
the graph sizes increase.
