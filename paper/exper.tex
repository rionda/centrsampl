\section{Experimental evaluation}\label{sec:exper}
We conducted and extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm and
compared its performances with those of other existing algorithm, both
exact~\citep{Brandes01} and approximate~\citep{BrandesP07,JacobKLPT05}.

\paragraph{Goals} TBD

\paragraph{Implementation and environment}
We implemented our algorithms, the one presented
in~\citep{BrandesP07,JacobKLPT05}, and the linear scaling version
from~\citep{GeisbergerSS08} in C, by extending the implementation of the
exact algorithm~\citep{Brandes01} contained in igraph~\citep{igraph}. The
implementations are very similarly engineering, given that they are based on the
same subroutines for the computation of the shortest path (Dijkstra's algorithm
for weighted graphs, BFS for unweighted ones) and received similar amount of
optimizations. We exposed our implementations through Python 3.3.1, which was
used for running the simulations. We run the experiments on a quad-core AMD
Phenom\texttrademark II X4 955 Processor with 16GB of RAM, running Debian
\emph{wheezy} with a Linux kernel version 3.2.0.

\paragraph{Datasets} We used a number of datasets from the Stanford Large
Network Dataset
Collection\footnote{\url{http://snap.stanford.edu/data/index.html}}. These are
all real world networks including online social networks, communication (email)
networks, scientific citation and academic collaboration networks, road
networks, Amazon frequent co-purchased product networks, and more. We refer the
reader to the SLNDC website for details about each dataset.
