\section{Experimental evaluation}\label{sec:exper}
We conducted and extensive experimental evaluation of our algorithm and
compared its performances with those of other existing algorithm, both
exact~\citep{Brandes01} and approximate~\citep{BrandesP08,JakobKLPT05}.

\paragraph{Goals} TBD

\paragraph{Implementation and environment}
We implemented our algorithm and the one presented
in~\citep{BrandesP08,JakobKLPT05} in C, by extending the implementation of the
exact algorithm~\citep{Brandes01} contained in igraph~\citep{igraph}. We
exposed our implementations through Python 3.3.1, which was used for running the
simulations. We run the experiments on a quad-core AMD Phenom\texttrademark II
X4 955 Processor with 16GB of RAM, running GNU/Linux 3.2.0.

\paragraph{Datasets} TBD
